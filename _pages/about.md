Hello, I am Yeonwoo Jeong from South Korea. You can call me "William."

As a medical student (MS2) in Seoul National University with a concurrent double major in Psychology, I aspire to become a warm-hearted neuropsychiatrist as well as develop a research career in biological psychiatry.

My long-term research goal is to further refine our conceptualization of mental illness by bridging the gap between pathophysiology and symptom-based nosology of psychiatric disorders. As a means to this objective, I wish to intertwine pioneering discoveries in the emerging field of neuroimmunology with a profound understanding of the human mind achievable through clinical expertise.

I believe brain immunity can effectively explain certain features (or subtypes) of mood disorders and, possibly, analogous characteristics in other diagnostic entities. Deciphering comparable biological mechanisms that span superficially heterogeneous conditions could facilitate the transition of exciting advances in modern neuroscience into novel therapeutic strategies. This would hopefully constitue more precise treatment options and individualized regimens to assist each and every patient to the fullest.

With a background in molecular biology and psychology, my current academic interests are:
<p>1) The induction and progression of neuroinflammation, and the role of neuron-glia interactions in such immunopathology.</p>
<p>2) Anatomical and/or physiological differences that make certain brain regions more susceptible to particular abnormalities in brain immunity.</p>
<p>3) Developmental consequences of early-life stress, especially in terms of the body-brain axis, and the protective mechanisms that let us overcome these adversities.</p>
You can find out more about my research journey in the [publications](/publications/) and [blog](/blog/) sections.

Apart from academics, I have always had a big passion for music and the performing arts. Orchestral concerts and musical theatre are my favorites, and I recently started venturing into new genres such as a capella and opera. You can see some of my performances (and other miscellaneous stuff) in the submenus section.

Feel free to look around (unfortunately, some maintenance undergoing for now)! If you have any questions or just want to connect, you can contact me through the below channels.
