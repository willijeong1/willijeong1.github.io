Hello, my name is Yeonwoo Jeong, and I also go by "William."

As a medical student (MS2) in Seoul National University with a concurrent double major in Psychology, I aspire to become a warm-hearted neuropsychiatrist as well as develop a research career in biological psychiatry.

My long-term research goal is to further refine our conceptualization of mental illness by bridging the gap between pathophysiology and symptom-based nosology of psychiatric disorders. By better characterizing the fundamental entities that comprise these dehumanizing conditions, we could get closer to breaking the painful stigmas unnecessarily cast upon those already suffering in agony.

As a means to this objective, I wish to intertwine pioneering discoveries in the emerging field of neuroimmunology with a profound understanding of the human mind achievable through clinical expertise. I believe brain immunity can effectively explain certain features (or subtypes) of mood disorders and, possibly, analogous characteristics in other diagnostic entities. Deciphering comparable biological mechanisms that span superficially heterogeneous conditions could facilitate the transition of exciting advances in modern neuroscience into novel therapeutic strategies. This would hopefully constitute more precise treatment options and individualized regimens to assist each and every patient to the fullest.

Moreover, I am genuinely intrigued by the infinite human potential and integrity that protects against mental illness beyond dimensions currently explainable by neuroscience. Striving to gain knowledge and experience that extends from molecular mechanisms to society and culture, I hope to support all of us, especially my future patients, in fully embracing and truly enjoying what life has in store for us.

With a background in molecular biology and psychology, my current academic interests are:
<p>1) The induction and progression of neuroinflammation, and the role of neuron-glia interactions in such immunopathology.</p>
<p>2) Anatomical and/or physiological differences that make certain brain regions more susceptible to particular abnormalities in brain immunity.</p>
<p>3) Developmental consequences of early-life stress, especially in terms of the body-brain axis, and the protective mechanisms that let us overcome these adversities.</p>
You can find out more about my research journey in the [publications](/publications) and [blog](/blog) sections.

Apart from academics, I have always had a big passion for music and the performing arts. Orchestral concerts and musical theatre are my favorites, and I recently started venturing into new genres such as a cappella and opera. You might encounter some of my performances (and other miscellaneous stuff) in the [blog](/blog) section.
