Hello there! My name is Yeonwoo Jeong, and I also go by "William."

With an academic background of psychology, medicine, and neuroscience across S. Korea and the U.S., I aspire to become a warm-hearted neuropsychiatrist and biopsychiatry researcher. Currently on my second research year, I am working on exciting research projects at the Claremont Colleges in LA and Weill Cornell Medical College in NYC.

From the dream of becoming a musician to the memories of the Floridian sunshine, the twists and turns bringing me to the present add up to my curiosity and fondness for diverse backgrounds shaping our unique and dynamic scenes of life.

My passion for mental health is a tribute to this vibrancy of life that "makes us who we are." Across a variety of experiences, I have continuously sought ways to fully embrace and cherish our ups and downs, along with ourselves going through them.

To better understand the entangled underpinnings of mental illness and, a step further, what it means to be ourselves, I wish to intertwine the following aspects into a holistic perspective:

<p>1) Picturing diversity in the human mind through lenses of psychoneuroimmunology and systems neuroscience.</p>
<p>2) Exploring the clinical implications of pioneering discoveries for more possibilities against mental illness.</p>
<p>3) Appreciating the individual trajectories and human potential in resilience and lifelong development.</p>
You can find out more about my research journey in the [publications](/publications) and [blog](/blog) sections.

Apart from academics, I have always had a big passion for music and the performing arts. Orchestral concerts and musical theatre are my favorites, and I recently started venturing into new genres such as a cappella and opera. You might encounter some of my performances, among other things, in the [blog](/blog) section.

Please feel free to look around! If you have any questions or just want to connect, you can contact me through the below channels.
