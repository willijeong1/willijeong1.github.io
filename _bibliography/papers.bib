  abstract={Intracellular accumulation of alpha-synuclein (aSyn) aggregates is a hallmark of synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA). In MSA, aSyn aggregates form glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) in oligodendrocytes, despite their low expression of aSyn. Here, we demonstrate that neuron-to-oligodendrocyte propagation of aSyn, via Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), contributes to GCI formation. Male transgenic mice expressing the A53T mutant human aSyn exclusively in neurons, and the preformed fibril injection model, exhibited MSA-like pathology, including GCI formation, gliosis, and neuroinflammation in the white matter. Notably, administration of NM-101, an anti-TLR2 antibody, significantly alleviated these pathological features. Transcriptome analyses revealed demyelination-related features in MSA oligodendrocytes and experimental models. Elevated TLR2 expression in MSA oligodendrocytes inversely correlated with MBP expression, and the correlation was absent in PD. In the transgenic mouse model, NM-101 administration rescued the demyelination phenotype. These findings highlight anti-TLR2 immunotherapy as a potential disease-modifying approach for MSA.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
