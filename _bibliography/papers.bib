  abstract={Intracellular accumulation of alpha-synuclein (aSyn) aggregates is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease and multiple system atrophy (MSA). In MSA, aSyn aggregates accumulate in oligodendrocytes as glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs). However, the origin of GCIs remains unclear, given the low expression levels of aSyn in oligodendrocytes. Here, we demonstrate that neuron-to-oligodendrocyte propagation of aSyn contributes to GCI formation and that this process is mediated by Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). In transgenic mice expressing the A53T mutant form of human aSyn exclusively in neurons, GCI formation, gliosis, and neuroinflammation were observed in the white matter. Similar pathological changes were observed in the preformed fibril (PFF) injection model of synucleinopathy. Notably, these MSA-like pathological features were significantly alleviated by administering NM-101, an anti-TLR2 antibody, both in mouse models and in neural stem cell-derived oligodendrocytes. Single-cell transcriptome analyses revealed demyelination-related features in neural stem cell-derived oligodendrocytes with GCIs, which were further confirmed by transcriptome analyses of MSA patients and the mouse model. TLR2 expression is elevated in oligodendrocytes of MSA patients, and it negatively correlates with MBP expression in oligodendrocytes of MSA, not in oligodendrocytes in PD. In the transgenic mouse model, NM-101 administration rescued the demyelination phenotype. These results suggest that GCIs form via neuron-to-oligodendrocyte aSyn propagation through TLR2, and that anti-TLR2 immunotherapy could serve as a promising disease-modifying strategy for MSA.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
