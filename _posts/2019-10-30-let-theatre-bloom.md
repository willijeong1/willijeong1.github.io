Putting together a full-blown musical performance was a challenge that appeared close to impossible for members of THE SCENE, a musical theatre club founded in 2018 in [Korean Minjok Leadership Academy](https://english.minjok.hs.kr/) (including me). We had almost no prior experience in actually staging shows before, let alone one of the world's finest masterpieces!

Setting on this overwhelming objective in the start of Spring 2019, we had so many worries about what could go wrong (who wouldn't?). However, as we spent tons and tons of our precious lunch and after-school hours steadily practicing and refining our performance, those worries eventually turned into hope. We even started to see ourselves in the characters; striving to live and love amidst frustrating, "miserable" conditions.

Continuing with our preparations for the show scheduled in late October, our growing interest towards "Les Misérables" prompted us to look across genres to the original novel written by Victor Hugo. Five passionate members of the musical club, including me, organized a semester-long course using the school's newly implemented "Integrated Project" curriculum, where we thoroughly went through the entire novel with French, European History, and English Literature teachers to truly understand the cultural and historical implications behind each scene of this massive work of pure brilliance. Although this again was a major endeavor, we discovered so many magnificent scenes and descriptions not well depicted in the musical that taught us closely about the ups and downs of human life, and the strong bond of love that transcends that turmoil.

Deeply inspired by the novel, we felt the need to convey its valuable messages across the language barrier to the people coming to see our show. We ourselves translated all of the subtitles for the musical performance into Korean, taking into account the narratives and character development rather simplified in the show as well as culturally specific connotations in the original French text. You can see the outcome in the subtitles of the following videos!

Listed below are the full videos of our two-hour-long performance. In terms of the actual performance, I was music coordinator and also played Enjolras with the red and gold jacket.

I would like to express my deepest gratitude to all THE SCENE members, especially the four brilliant friends without whom the journey through the novel would have been merely unthinkable.
