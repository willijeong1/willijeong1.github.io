*** This was an individual term project in the “French Reading & Writing Ⅱ” course in Spring 2020 at [Korean Minjok Leadership Academy](https://english.minjok.hs.kr/), supervised by the French teacher. This course, taken in the spring semester of the senior year (twelfth grade), is designed for advanced French learners at CEFR B1–B2 level. Alongside reading and discussing “Le Petit Prince” by Antoine de Saint-Exupery and “L’étranger” by Albert Camus, this individual term project encouraged students (like me) to choose an originally French text and indulge in thoroughly understanding the material in its original entirety to incorporate it in a research topic of choice.

Abstract

Patient-centered care has become the crux of doctor-patient relationships nowadays. Various medical institutions worldwide are developing patient-centered processes in virtue of promoting internal healing from the patient’s ultimate medical experience. However, there are problems in incorporating patient-centered care into existing medical systems, especially regarding psychiatric discourses. Korea is not an exception, only that communication is made further difficult by the characteristic social, cultural, and linguistic backgrounds of Korean patients.

To introduce a new perspective into Korean psychiatric patient-centered care, Jacques Lacan’s psychoanalytic examination methods were to be compared with the fundamental processes of patient-centered psychiatric discourse. Here, we thoroughly reviewed “Présentation de Gérard Lucas,” a record of one of Lacan’s public discourses, focusing on subtle nuances of the French language. Analyzing the process of this discourse, the recognition and acceptance of “sinthome,” a Lacanian concept for symptoms that are to prevent ego death, were found analogous to the essential values of “healing” pursued during patient-centered psychiatric therapy. Linguistically symbolized psychiatric advice, from perspectives similar to the acceptance of sinthome, may provide new insights for culturally sensitive patient-centered discourse in Korean psychiatric therapy.
