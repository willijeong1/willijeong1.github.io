    MOCA, a cappella for everyone.
</div>

MOCA is an acronym of "modu-ui (모두의; of everyone) acappella," which I think is already an ample explanation of what we do in this club. MOCA is an amateur a cappella club where students in the College of Medicine in Seoul National University get together to host annual shows of "voice magic" open to the school and hospital community as well as visitors. For me, MOCA is a grateful opportunity to ventilate and relax, away from my medical studies and research.

As a member, I sang in a number of performances, mainly as a tenor. Below are a list of videos that I appear in. I hope some songs sound familiar!

I also belong to the musical coordination team, where we manage our extensive reservoir of a cappella scores and compose or transcribe cool songs we encounter on the internet (or help a member do so). Most importantly, we select songs for the annual show program and assign members to each song, considering various aspects such as vocal range and color, the character of each performance, voice blending, and so on. I have made and shared quite a few a cappella arrangements myself; I look forward to putting some of those on stage eventually.

    My performance in the 9th annual concert in October 2023. "Snow" by Rajaton. This one was my first song as a team leader. Can you feel the subtle sounds of snow falling outside the window?

    My performances in the 10th annual concert in October 2024. (left) "Ebb Tide" by The Righteous Brothers (arr. Fred King). Our very first and successful attempt at a barbershop quartet! (right) "Butterfly" by Rajaton. This song has a weird ethnic (?) vibe and we all loved it.
