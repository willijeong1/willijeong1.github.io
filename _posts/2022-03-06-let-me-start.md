After the [success](/blog/2019/let-theatre-bloom/) of "Les Misérables" in high school, I started to get really immersed in the musical theatre genre. Especially with the COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine going on in South Korea, I was seeking an opportunity to connect with people at Seoul National University who share that passion for music and performance. So it wasn't strange that I hastily submitted my application for Let Me Start, the one-and-only musical theatre club at SNU!

Let Me Start is a bustling club consisting of five teams (director, musical coordinator, actor, stage designer, and administrator) and hosts semiannual licensed performances, fully staging a show selected at the start of each semester. The works usually staged are original Korean musicals written for small casts, and club members devote their school breaks to intensive daily workshops on character development, scene-making, and musical numbers. As a member of the musical coordinator team, I took part in two such performances: "Airport Baby" in September 2021 as a new member and "Superman with the Moon" in February 2022 as music director.

"Airport Baby" is the story of Josh Cohen, a young Korean American adopted to a Jewish household in the U.S. when he was two years old. Josh has an unsolved question about self-identity that countinuously haunted his mind throughout his childhood and adolescent years: "Where are my roots? Where did I come from?" Initially to meet his Korean birth mother, Josh returns to South Korea to discover the dark reality of his past, unexpectedly encountering friends also searching for "who they really are" on his way. Borrowing Josh's monologue near the end, he "lives in the present, finds the past, and now awaits the future."

"Superman with the Moon" has a rather omnibus-like storyline about five young adults in a hillside low-income neighborhood* in Seoul, South Korea. Although the musical mainly provides a lens into the daily life and comic struggles of these friendly, relatable people, it also lets us dive into their histories and untold secrets. One of the iconic characters in this show is Wuhyeon, a young man with intellectual disability who "believes that he can fly," just like Superman (as in the title). While this arrangement surprises many, it is suggested later in the show that Wuhyeon's seemingly childish ambition could have another meaning to it.

*Note: "Moon" in the title refers to "Daldongne (달동네; Moon-Town)," a Korean expression that corresponds to "shantytown" or "slum." During rapid urban development in the late 20th century, such neighborhoods formed in the yet underdeveloped, hilly areas of Seoul with steep alleys between closely built houses. The metaphor is said to come from the idea that the moon is seen clearer and "closer" on the hills.

Aside from the performances, Let Me Start has a very lively community where I could make many close friends from different majors and backgrounds. There were club gatherings, occasional vlogs and special projects, and even galas (also open to past club members) where we would get together to sing and dance to some of our favorite musicals. However, among all those memories, those I really look back to are of the heartwarming celebrations that we planned for each other.

    This is a special project in January 2022 that I organized as music director, featuring club members singing "You Will Be Found" from the Broadway musical "Dear Evan Hansen" to spread togetherness in the midst of COVID-19 quarantine. I translated the lyrics into Korean and directed practice workshops and recording sessions.

My experience in Let Me Start was not always easygoing, but in the end, I think it all comes down to a memory I often look back on, whenever I find myself in challenging situations in medical school. Thank you, Let Me Start members, for being a part of my "good times."
